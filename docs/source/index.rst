Welcome to EmbeddedUtilityLibraries's documentation!
====================================================

**EmbeddedUtilityLibraries** is a set of C++ libraries dedicated to embedded development. 

.. attention::
   The whole project is in the very early stage of development. Therefore, it contains a lot of bugs and design issues.

Design is to meet goals: 

- forbidden dynamic memory usage (some of the libraries break that rule for now)
- simple design and implementation 
- use of modern C++
- intended for the latest compiler versions 

This project is under maintenance by a single person. 
Therefore, there are no plans specified for further development. 
Instead, the features and fixes will come when they are needed.
